PySOM - The Simple Object Machine Smalltalk
===========================================

Introduction
------------

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect that was used to teach at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM] and before that at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was used for teaching and as the foundation for [Resilient
Smalltalk][RS].

In addition to PySOM, other implementations exist for Java (SOM, TruffleSOM),
C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), Python (PySOM), and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains a Python-base implementation of SOM, including
SOM's standard library, and a number of benchmarks. The [main project
page][SOMst] has links to other SOM VM implementations.

PySOM implementation use an abstract-syntax-tree.

To check out the code, run:

    git clone -b ast-only --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SOM-st/PySOM.git

Note the `--recurse-submodules` option. It makes sure that the core library,
i.e., the Smalltalk code is downloaded.

PySOM's tests can be executed with:

    ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program can be started with:

    ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello.som

Optinal: To compile PySOM, a recent PyPy is recommended and the RPython source
code is required. The source distribution of PyPy 7.3 can be used like this:

    wget https://downloads.python.org/pypy/pypy2.7-v7.3.1-src.tar.bz2
    tar xvf pypy2.7-v7.3.1-src.tar.bz2
    export PYPY_DIR=`pwd`/pypy2.7-v7.3.1-src/

History
-------

In 2013, the implementations of PySOM, RPySOM, and RTruffleSOM where split
over multiple repositories. Since end of 2020, they are reunited here and PySOM
can be used with Python 2.7, Python 3.8, as well as compiled with RPython.
Thus, https://github.com/SOM-st/PySOM is again the only and the canonical
repository.
